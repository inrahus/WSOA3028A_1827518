                        A Digital Arts 3rd Year @ Wits University who really likes socio-political convos, YA novels,

                        As the daughter of an Indian man and a Coloured woman in the South African context, dealing with
                        racism on both the local and international scales have shaped many of my core qualities and my
                        deep
                        obsession with understanding the other.

                        Growing up, I lived in Mauritius for a while, an i condser the island my childhood home. I moved
                        back to South Africa just as high school started and have been trying to navigate this context
                        that
                        really values raciaol and cultural identities.
