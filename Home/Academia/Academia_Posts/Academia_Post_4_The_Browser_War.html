                    #4, The Browser Wars
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The Browser Wars are really funny. Hilarious really. Very, very, very, <em>petty</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning shall we?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a man named Tim (Berners-Lee, but we'll call him Tim, like any developer
                    would
                    prefer). He created the first web browser. He called it the WorldWideWeb. As
                    the years went on, he decided to change the name. First to Nexus, and from Nexus to NeXTstep.
                    Because of Tim's amazing discovery. Or more his amazing invention rather, many others realised the
                    potential that his great masterpiece held, and so, they began to create their own - but mostly based
                    on his version. After the brief Mosaic War - which i won't be discussing, but if you're interested
                    here's a link : Mosaic Wars - the WorldWideWeb became known as Netscape Navigator. </p>

                <p>
                    And so it began. The First Browser War. The War of 1995 (to 2001).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Netscape Navigator was ahead of the game. Even with the existence of several other browsers,
                    Netscape remained the most widely used browser. Then one day, Microsoft created Internet Explorer
                    2.0. And Internet Explorer 2.0 was free for all Windows users. And the war began.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rapid releases of versions of each browser were being released. Companies followed in the steps of
                    Internet Explorer and release theirs for free. Others and Netscape did not. They instead provided
                    package deals that included an email client, downloads manager and even an HTML editor. There was
                    much more than this obviously and they were dubbed, "Internet Suites".
