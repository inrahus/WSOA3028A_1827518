                    #2, Learning about URls.
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Doing a degree in Digital Art is very interesting. In this particular course, as you can see, we're
                    learning about web design. There's a great focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this particular
                    course - and one of the most fundamental things I had to learnt o undertand was how URLs work, and
                    more importantloy, what they are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    URL. It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Simple. Three words.
                    <br>
                    But what [the fuck] does that mean?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Basically it's how you find something on the web. It's address to a resource. It could lead to
                    anything honestly. A page, a picture, a video. But each URL is unique for each unique resource. The
                    way URLs are shown to the world are dependent on the owener of the web server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    URLs, are pretty complex though. They consist of several parts which are - mostly - necessary. Just
                    like an item in a box in a place in another place and maybe even abother place that you're looking
                    for, you need some vital pieces of information. Using that
                    comparison, I will attempt to explain priefly the parts of a URL that I am aware of.

                    <strong>
                        There are a six main parts:
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Protocol
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <em> http </em>. This isthe method used to transfer data on a computer network. if it its
                        <em>http<strong>S </strong></em> then the method is secure, as compared to just, <em>http</em>.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Domain Name
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is your <em>www.</em> to your <em>.com</em>. Your website. Sometimes people use IP adresses
                        but a domain name is more legible, understandable, and therfore accessible.
