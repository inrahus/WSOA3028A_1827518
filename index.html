                            After receiving feedback that there is still a necessary distinction required
                            between the character and the real, I have decided to implement the following
                            changes to the context of my character for the duration of the course:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The character exists in a version of Johannesburg, in the year 2020, where the
                            Corona Virus did not exist as such a major threat in South Africa and therefore, no
                            quarantine is apparent.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The change will reflect in a post in Perspective - detailing how the Corona Virus
                            threat was dealt with swiftly by government. (Will add link soon).
