                    Lately I've been hanging out with a lot of my friends who love making music. They're upcoming
                    artists, in a country that loves music and even more want to pursue it. It's rough, but it is a
                    beautiful thing to see them follow their passions. So for this post, I've decided to share some of
                    the local talent that I am a fan of!!
