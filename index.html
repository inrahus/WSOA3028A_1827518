                        <h4>
                            #1, Memex.
                        </h4>

                        <p id="asidepara">
                            The idea of the "Memex" was first intoduced by Vannevar Bush in his work, <em>"As We May
                                Think".</em>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The conceptual device that Bush described would act as a memory supplement of sorts. Memex
                            being a
                            shortened form for "memory extender". The machine
                            would store information just as a library would. However, it would be extremely fast and
                            function -
                            like memory - as a large interlaced web-where one piece of information could easily lead to
                            another. At the time the idea was wild and fantastical. But with the development of
                            technology,
                            Bush's idea
                            has come to light in the digital form.

                            #2, URLs.

                            URL. It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Simple. Three words.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            But what does that mean? What does it stand for? Why is it important?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Basically it's how you find something on the web. It's address to a resource. It could lead
                            to
                            anything. A page, a picture, a video. But each URL is unique for each unique resource. The
                            way URLs are shown to the world are dependent on the owner of the web server.
