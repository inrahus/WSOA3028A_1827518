                            After receiving feedback that there is still a necessary distinction required
                            between the character and the real, I have decided to implement the following
                            changes to the context of my character for the duration of the course:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The character exists in a version of Johannesburg, in the year 2020, where the
                            Corona Virus did not exist as such a major threat in South Africa and therefore, no
                            quarantine is apparent.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The change will reflect in a post in Perspective - detailing how the Corona Virus
                            threat was dealt with swiftly by government. (Will add link soon).

                            UX, or User Experience, is a subjective result that is obtained when a person interacts with
                            an object
                            or artifact. There are three main aspects to a UX. First, the object/artifact that is
                            interacted with.
                            Second, the user themselves - their expectations, desires and needs have an influence over
                            the
                            experience. And thirdly, the context in which the user and the object engage with each
                            other.
