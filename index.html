                            Intially, I had wanted to implement a simple, pastel theme to the site. However, after
                            much research, and many dfferent colour palette generators, I found myself settling on
                            using
                            <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/189889">this colour palette</a>, as a basic
                            reference to start with. I found this palette showed the character's more bold streaks
                            and complemented the blog as a whole in a way that I found both aesthetic and internally
                            satisfying.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I then also took into account the feedback given and removed my "style" tags and instead
                            implemented CSS StyleSheets - of which there were four main ones.

                            UX, or User Experience, is a subjective result that is obtained when a person interacts with
                            an object
                            or artifact. There are three main aspects to a UX. First, the object/artifact that is
                            interacted with.
                            Second, the user themselves - their expectations, desires and needs have an influence over
                            the
                            experience. And thirdly, the context in which the user and the object engage with each
                            other.
