                <h4>
                    Equality vs Equity vs Justice
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                With regards to the issues of Gender Based Violence, BlackLivesMatter and the Collins Khosa case that
                was in recent media, I believe it is important to shed light on the definitions and differences between
                the terms pertaining to these movements. This would not only allow for a better understanding of each
                movement and the necessary actions that need to be implicated, but also why it is necessary to
                acknowlegde why we ask for one over the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent happenings, cases pertaining to the victims of people who abuse their power and roles - such
                as these
                George Floyd and the Collins Khosa cases in particular - have
                surfaced openly on social media and have given way to movements that have asked for justice. In any
                cases people without or with little knowledge of the past as well as current social affairs, and those
                who find their privileges threatened by the idea of it, have come to either ignore these movements,
                undermine them or dictate that the presence of "Equal" Law has already created the reperations necessary
                for the centuries of oppression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equality is broadly defines and understood as, giving the same treatment and opportunities to all. In
                past movements, this was often the forefront of campaigns, from the Suffragette movements in both the UK
                and USA, the Civil RIghts movement of the USA and even in the Equal Education movement on South Africa.
                Although this sounds like it is a solution, this particular form of reparation, was rather minimal to
                ask for but did help bridge major societial divides at their respective times. Equality, is also very
                inconsiderate of heights of the inequalities between social, racial and economical classes.
                It does not consider that each divide requires a different type of support - it is morally, quite
                ignorant.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brings us to equity.
            </p>
            <p>
                With equity, we find this defined as giving what is neccesary in order to make this fair. This a
                considerate apporach and is still found today, mostly in the employment and financial sectors. In
                South Africa, one way that equity was promoted, was through the introduction of BEE. Not only this this
                system aim to equalise opportunities, it recognised the barriers, and legislatively ensured that there
                be a brigding of the gaps created by the financial, racial and societal impacts fo the segregation
                present pre-Independence. Currently we find this being the best way to address issues in the current
                climates, but it is also a method that, although acknowledges the barriers set up, and atrempts to
                bridge this gap, it does nothing about
                the existence of these barriers. It says, "Yes, there is a problem, but her's how you overcome it even
                if you are struggling. But I'm sorry, I can't do anything about this problem existing."
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach, although generally accepted, is still a result of greed and preservation of privilege.
                Even in the case of the BEE in out country - although there were systems but in place to overcome the
                barrier of workplace diversity, it does not consider that the systemic barrier can be completely
                demolished
                through other means - such as Equal Education, nor does it acknowledge the history of the systemic
                barrier and what is necessary to directly address to negate it. Although they allow for the
                diversification of
                workplaces, they often do not consider that by investing in other areas, the problem can be address and
                solved
                appropriately - and more permanently. Most of the time, equity, although constitutiing an idea of
                fairness and eventually leading to a place of equality,is a method that finds itself, complacent with
                the barriers it is aimed to address - more of a, "These are the rules of the wall, sorry, we can't break
                it but if we bend it you can get through too."
            </p>
            <p>
                And this, thus, brings us to the concept of justice. This term is oftem associated with legal terms and
                thereby the legal meaning of it. However, with the presence of societal injustice, societal justice
                exists in counterpart. In terms of the previously mentioned movements and causes - GBV, BLM and the case
                of Collins Khosa - the justice that is wanted, and needed, by those who face the societal injustice, is
                removal of the systemic barriers that exist and threaten, not only the progresson of these previously
                oppressed, but their welling, safety and livelihoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most curent and prominent appication of this is the need for justice in regards to the
                BlackLivesMatter movement - predominately in the USA - that pertains specifically to the police force,
                and the treatment of POCs and especially the Black community of the United States. In asking for
                equality, they are asking that the opportunites and treatment from the police and do do with the police
                department, but how is this acheived? We can say that there is an addressing of the issue in equity by
                saying that there exist scholarships and funding directly in place for Black students of the country who
                which to further themselves in the law enforcement field. The presence of people of colour and the Black
                community in the law enforcemtn - the fact that there are balck cops, seems to be the biggest arguement
                against the reform of the department as awhole, and even the movements to defund this sector.But is this
                really
                enough?
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply. No. It is not enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                These scolarships acknowledge the inequalities presented by being Black in the USA and what that means
                financially and even the issues of diversity within the department but it does not solve the lack of
                opportunity that they have, nor does it change the way that the police/law enforcement treat these
                minorites. The systemic barrier of law enforcement in america was introduce as a means to control and
                regulate the moevement and obedience of the slaves who were brought to or taken on the land. This
                history has shaped what it means to identify and how to treat the other in the situation. In order for
                equality to be acheived, justice must be acheived. There needs to be an acknowlegdement of the roots of
                the department, thand there needs to be a change in the way that the memebers of the department are
                educated - from areas earlier than just their training at the academy or any law enforcement
                qualification domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                There needs to be a removal or comeplete remediation of the law enforcement department, and these
                radical approachesfind themselves necessary for these endgoals to be acheived. IN order to acheve the
                basic idea of equality that we all desire and require to survive in the society that dominates the world
                to day, we have to target the barrier - the walls, and remove them, not work around them. Working around
                them is a compromise on the side of the oppressed in order for the oppressors to retain their
                privilege. In the case of BLM and the law enforcement, it is retaining the power that the police have
                over
                these citizens, and the allowing of this position to be one of power when it is meant to be a position
                of servitude and protection. This applies in direct link to the case of the SANDF and Colliins Khosa who
                was murdered in his home as the police forced themselve in and exerted their power over him, when they
                should have first and formost been worried for his safety, wellbeing and the wellbeing of those aroumd
                him. Instead they compromised those very wellbeings that they are meant to be defending.
