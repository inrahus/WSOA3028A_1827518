                <h4>
                    The Impact of the Digital Divide.
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                The Digital Divide is greatest manifestation of Digital Inequality.
                <br>
                <br>
                This form of inequality had not only become as prominent as traditional forms of inequality - which
                include: race, class, gender etc - but it has become intwined with the tradtional forms, as mentionsed
                by the authors of "Digital inequalites and why they matter". This divide
                plays a major role in several aspects of life. WIth the
                merging of the digital platforms and reality, the actions taken on either and the repercussions on
                both, the impact of the Digital Divide has allowed the world to indugle in a concept of technology
                dependency and insuffiency on several levels.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the article by Carmen Steele, on the Digital Divide Council site, there is an exploration of several
                sectors that the Digital Divide has a large play in. Namely, education, the economy, social interaction,
                society as a whole, and culture. Steele explains how income and digital literacy are crucial
                contributors to the Digital Divide, but also that these do not reflect the only factors that contribute
                to the racial and ethnic imbalance of digital platforms today. In the article, "Digital inequalities and
                why they matter", the authors identified that race, ethinicity and gender - regardless of the country's
                high level of technological adoption - present equal disadvantage when it comes to the Digital
                Divide.The sectors that Steele elaborates on
                further display just how the disparities show themselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the internet serves as a rich accumlation of the world's knowledge, the lack of access to the
                internet itself already presents a fundamentally large gap - with no access to the internet, there is no
                access to it's knowledge. Without access to the knowledge of the how and what of the internet, there is
                no way to access it or further obtain knowlegde regarding it. Paired with this, the lack of
                technological
                literacy finds effect in the education sector, and the biggest victims of this, are countries with
                weak/new education systems - mainly in developing countries where the overall idea of technology is not
                as adept as that of the world that is comfortable with the medium. Another factor that is affected by
                this controlled knowledge, is the gender factor tat contributes to the divide, which is present in when
                it comes to both education and job opportunity.
