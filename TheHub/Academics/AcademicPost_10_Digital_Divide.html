                <h4>
                    The Impact of Inequality on the Digital Divide.
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                The Digital Divide is greatest manifestation of Digital Inequality.
                <br>
                <br>
                This form of inequality had not only become as prominent as traditional forms of inequality - which
                include: race, class, gender etc - but it has become intwined with the tradtional forms, as mentioned
                by the authors of "Digital inequalites and why they matter". This divide
                plays a major role in several aspects of life. With the
                merging of the digital platforms and reality, the actions taken on either and the repercussions on
                both, the impact of the Digital Divide has allowed the world to indulge in a concept of technology
                dependency and insuffiency on several levels.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the article by Carmen Steele, on the Digital Divide Council site, there is an exploration of several
                sectors that the Digital Divide has a large play in. Namely - as I will elaborate on - education, social
                interaction and
                society as a whole, and culture. Steele explains how income and digital literacy are crucial
                contributors to the Digital Divide, but also that these do not reflect the only factors that contribute
                to the racial and ethnic imbalance of digital platforms today. In the article, "Digital inequalities and
                why they matter", the authors identified that race, ethinicity and gender - regardless of the country's
                high level of technological adoption - present equal - if not additional disadvantage when it comes to
                the Digital
                Divide.The sectors that Steele elaborates on
                further display just how the disparities show themselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the internet serves as a rich accumlation of the world's knowledge, the lack of access to the
                internet itself already presents a fundamentally large gap - with no access to the internet, there is no
                access to it's knowledge. Without access to the knowledge of the how and what of the internet, there is
                no way to access it or further obtain knowlegde regarding it. Paired with this, the lack of
                technological literacy finds effect in the education sector, and the biggest victims of this, are
                countries with
                weak/new education systems - mainly in developing countries where the overall idea of technology is not
                as adept as that of the world that is comfortable with the medium. It firthers the disparity between not
                only the priveleged and underprivileged, the first and developing world countries, but also between
                generations in these seperate contexts. There is a divide between the people of the same generation
                because of the lack of access and lack of technological litaracy that is present to the other. Another
                factor that is affected by
                this controlled knowledge, is the gender factor, which is present in when
                it comes to both education and job opportunity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Studies presented in the "Digital inequalites and why they matter" showed that women were spent less
                time using the access they had - if they did, and report less intensity of their time spent there, as
                well as having less activities to perform using this medium. These directly intersect with two main
                factors pointed out in the work - one, the gendering of technical skills and content, and two - which
                stems from this - is the gendering of jobs and opportunities. The internet has long stood as an
                extension of the reality we live in, and thereby serves to extend not only our interests but the roles
                and expctations that we are socialised into. It is why many women spent less time investing into the
                internet - unless mostly for the social aspect that was also required and forced on them outside the
                digital platforms they occupied. This furthers the Digital Divide between men and women, showing how the
                digital space is in need of a bridging - by opening and allowing more space for the feminine to explore
                aspects of the digital.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another factor that majorly contributes, is that of race, ethnicity and culture. As Steele mentions in
                her article - and as seen previously when discussing education - the limit of access to the internet has
                left developing countries behind, furthering the gap as they are still beginning to incorporate
                technology into their existing culture. With the countries that are more developed, we see now
                technology and access to technology has become a commidity and deeply intergrated in many aspects of the
                cultures present there today. However, even in these developed countries race and ethnicity have proven
                to be major setbacks in terms of access to digital platforms and thus contributors to the Divide.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the article, "Digital inequalites and why they matter", the evidence displays how the minority of
                users are people of colour (POC). POCs experience a mass of inequalities outside the digital space and
                it can be seen in hw it translates into the digital. The lack of access, different in class with
                reference to race, ethinicity and gender show how the inequalities of race and ethnicity carry oeveronto
                the internet. As a majority of the population that has lack of access to the internet are POCs, we see
                how there is already a clear racial and ethnical divide. However, even in countries with access, POCs
                form minorities in terms of population as a whole and even in terms of income - how they are the general
                less earning, we see how these external factors further the Digital Divide in terms of ethnicity and
                race.
                <br>
                <br>
                This as a whole represents exactly how we cannot seperate the idea of traditional discrimation from that
                of the digtal, as it is the tradition forms that influence the accessbility and ability to participate
                and represent on the digital platform, and thereby are forms of digital inequality. The effects of this
                on education, gender, race and culture in reality shows how the digital serves as an extention of said
                reality, and how in return, these factors contribute to the Digital Divide.
