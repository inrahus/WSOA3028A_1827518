                    Information Geography.

                <p>
                    Information has the ability to not only reflect but it is something that also shapes the way we see
                    and understand different parts of the world.
                    And so, because of it's nature, information geographies has become a political playground.
                    Information geography works on the basis that information is from, about and transforms and evolves
                    <em>somewhere</em>.
                    A means used by collectives to define and redefine the narratives of the different parts of the
                    world.
                    These geographies are influenced by a number of uneven geographic factors - namely: access,
                    participation and representation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Information has always varied - in terms of it's roots, by who and how it is absorbed and how it is
                    contextualised in terms of it's relation to geography.
                    It is because of this flexible nature of information, that it has become intricately tied into power
                    dynamics.
                    The way that the information is represented can create shared ideals, understandings and views.
                    And so, these augmentations become a part of the place.
                    The information no longer alone reflect the place, but it creates annotations - associations.
                    Simply put, information geography is a crucial form of control and power - one that is heavily
                    intergrated into the media that we consume information from, it always has been.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to digital geographies of information, information was far few between. It was often hard to
                    find because it was contained to one particular geographic area.
                    On top of that, information was inaccessible because of academic nature - few understood the
                    available information, and even fewer could conribute to it.
                    Since pre-digital forms were bound to their material medium, they could never transend geographical
                    barriers and thus gave way to a hegamoic representation of the world.
                    This supremist takeover of information was a great factor in the power relations - influencing not
                    only politics, but the socio-ecomomic environments that thet were present in.
                    These tradition mediums - mostly books, or paper formats - are distinguishable by their geographic
                    inconsistencies. Most of the time information was produced and spread among the Northern regions of
                    the globe.
                    The Southern hemisphere played a significantly minor role in the establishment and dispersion of the
                    information. This uneven relationship gave way to a a marginalised and exclusive view on
                    information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the introduction of digital mediums however, the barriers that were previously very prevalent,
                    have lowered. Digital forms created a more broad based sense of participation and representation.
                    It allowed for people to play a more key role in the augmentations and shaping of the imformation
                    geopraghies. This technology has the ability to equalise opportunities and allow people to - not
                    only have access to, but also contribute to the content regardless of geographic placement.
                    But, just because it has these capabilites, does not mean that it is being used to fulfil it's full
                    potential. Theoretically, this platform should allow participation of diffrent representations and
                    geographies, but because of access, participation and representation geographies, the full extent of
                    the digital platform is limited.
