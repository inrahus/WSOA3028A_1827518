                    Information Geography.
                </h4>
            </section>

                <p>
                    Information has the ability to not only reflect but it is something that also shapes the way we see
                    and understand different parts of the world.
                    And so, because of it's nature, information geographies has become a political playground.
                    Information geography works on the basis that information is from, about and transforms and evolves
                    <em>somewhere</em>.
                    A means used by collectives to define and redefine the narratives of the different parts of the
                    world.
                    These geographies are influenced by a number of uneven geographic factors - namely: access,
                    participation and representation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Information has always varied - in terms of it's roots, by who and how it is absorbed and how it is
                    contextualised in terms of it's relation to geography.
                    It is because of this flexible nature of information, that it has become intricately tied into power
                    dynamics.
                    The way that the information is represented can create shared ideals, understandings and views.
                    And so, these augmentations become a part of the place.
                    The information no longer alone reflect the place, but it creates annotations - associations.
                    Simply put, information geography is a crucial form of control and power - one that is heavily
                    intergrated into the media that we consume information from, it always has been.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to digital geographies of information, information was far few between. It was often hard to
                    find because it was contained to one particular geographic area.
                    On top of that, information was inaccessible because of academic nature - few understood the
                    available information, and even fewer could conribute to it.
                    Since pre-digital forms were bound to their material medium, they could never transend geographical
                    barriers and thus gave way to a hegamoic representation of the world.
                    This supremist takeover of information was a great factor in the power relations - influencing not
                    only politics, but the socio-ecomomic environments that thet were present in.
                    These tradition mediums - mostly books, or paper formats - are distinguishable by their geographic
                    inconsistencies. Most of the time information was produced and spread among the Northern regions of
                    the globe.
                    The Southern hemisphere played a significantly minor role in the establishment and dispersion of the
                    information. This uneven relationship gave way to a a marginalised and exclusive view on
                    information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the introduction of digital mediums however, the barriers that were previously very prevalent,
                    have lowered. Digital forms created a more broad based sense of participation and representation.
                    It allowed for people to play a more key role in the augmentations and shaping of the imformation
                    geographies. This technology has the ability to equalise opportunities and allow people to - not
                    only have access to, but also contribute to the content regardless of geographic placement.
                    But, just because it has these capabilites, does not mean that it is being used to fulfil it's full
                    potential. Theoretically, this platform should allow participation of diffrent representations and
                    geographies, but because of access, participation and representation geographies, the full extent of
                    the digital platform is limited.

                        Although there are several factors, such as internet penetration and overall population
                        access,
                        that play a role in the accessibility of digital mediums - the most prevalent and still
                        ongoing
                        issue is that of broadband affordabilty. The relative costs of fixed broadband subscription
                        charges is one of the major setbacks when it omes to access - i.e. the cost of access where
                        there is access available. In Europe and North America, the cost of subscription is
                        relatively
                        low in relation to the avergae salary - costing what would require a few hours of a month's
                        work
                        to afford - approximately 10% or less of the total income for the month.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In Africa, however, the cost can vary from a minimum of 10% of the total salary, to a
                        surplus of
                        250% of the average income of the country. Costs remain a pivotal barrier in the African
                        continent and can majorly be contributed not just to the exploitation of the everyday
                        civilian
                        by these few major corporations who wish to capatilise on the access that is necessary for
                        the
                        digital growth of the country - but also the fact that the incomes in the African countries
                        is
                        simply, too low.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Research suggest sand shows that even though prices have in many places across the
                        continent,
                        dropped significantly - it is still an unreasomable feat to consider it as a commodity when
                        that
                        same amount could eaily contribute to the necessities that the average civilian requires
                        their
                        salary to cover. It is a matter of importance and the hierarchy of needs that is not only
                        heavily present in out continent but in other developing countries worldwide.

                        When it comes to this particluar contributing factors, Africa finds itself a victim of the
                        very
                        power play that information geography aims to control. Because of the lack of access to the
                        internet - which can be seen in the Western dominated domain names and lack of presence in
                        the
                        GitHub collaborative community. Africa finds itself close to complete ommittance in a
                        digital
                        space that is heavily dominated by the Noth American and European contributors to the
                        internet.

                        <br>
                        Another way that participation was checked was through the local editings of pages - which
                        were
                        relevant in context - through
                        Wikipedia.Although Kenya and Niigeria have the most local contributions to content, the rest
                        of
                        the
                        continent contributes only 5% local content which is stark in contrast to that of the
                        Americas
                        and Europe, who's local content and contributions is over 75% each.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The lack of access to technology finds Africa participating in involuntary ommitance from
                        digital spaces and thereby furthering the inability to affect their geographical
                        information. It
                        allows for the views of the other to be more prominent, and thus presents the same issues as
                        the
                        predigital era - the marginalisation and exclusive view of the geography.
