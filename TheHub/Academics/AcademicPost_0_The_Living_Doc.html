                    As compared to the other works in this section. This ever evolving piece will illustrate the reasons
                    for
                    the decisions I have made while creating this website. From the portrayal of character to the
                    layout,
                    this particular page dictates why and how choices were made.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most recent additions are detailed in bold and italicised.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sections detailed below are the ones the brief has laid out to be major consideration points of
                    the
                    process.

                            Character.

                        Detailed in the brief for the creation of this site was the character who made the site. The
                        character had to be based in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, - and regardless of
                        content, would have to show development as they somehow interacted with the city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While
                        brainstorming ideas, I came up with two main thought processes I wanted to explore. Characters
                        based on my parents. Both characters would have been a 20 year-old version of the chosen parent
                        and I would have explored the way they would have dealt with the same struggles they had growing
                        up - but in the context of a 2020 Johannesburg-residing student at the University of
                        Witwatersrand.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While proposing these ideas to my group with a tutor present, I also contextualised myself and
                        the struggles I had - of which were quite similar in sense, and yet vastly different in
                        experience. I received feedback that suggested I push forward with a character based on myself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the beginning - although the idea was quite tempting, I wondered what would come to be of the
                        blog should I have it centre on me - especially detailing aspects of personal life as I would
                        include members of family and friends as their lives entertwined with mine. Eventually, I
                        compared the pros and cons - and I also asked for the relavant permissions from the people close
                        to me whom I felt would be involved in this idea of mine, and rather than
                        just basing the character on myself, I decided to fully allow the chracter to be me. A student,
                        living in Joburg, in 2020.

                        <br>
                        I have eventual plans for the site itself to be continued for personal use after the course and
                        the creative content details exactly what I would put out going forward.

                                    After recieving feedback that there is still a necessary distinction required
                                    between the character and the real, I have decided to implement the following
                                    changes to the context of my character for the duration of the course:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The character exists in a version of Johannesburg, in the year 2020, where the
                                    Corona Virus did not exist as such a major threat in South Africa and therefore, no
                                    quarantine is apparent.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The change will reflect in a post in Perspective - detailing how the Corona Virus
                                    threat was dealt with swiftly by government. (Will add link soon).
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Perspective Posts will continue as per usual, with this distinct different in
                                    worlds.
