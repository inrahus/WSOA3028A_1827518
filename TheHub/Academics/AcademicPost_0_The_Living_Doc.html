                    As compared to the other works in this section. This ever evolving piece will illustrate the reasons
                    for
                    the decisions I have made while creating this website. From the portrayal of character to the

                    this particular page dictates why and how choices were made.

                        Detailed in the brief for the creation of this site was the character who made the site. The
                        character had to be based in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, - and regardless of
                        content, would have to show development as they somehow interacted with the city.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While
                        brainstorming ideas, I came up with two main thought processes I wanted to explore. Characters
                        based on my parents. Both characters would have been a 20 year-old version of the chosen parent
                        and I would have explored the way they would have dealt with the same struggles they had growing
                        up - but in the context of a 2020 Johannesburg-residing student at the University of
                        Witwatersrand.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While proposing these ideas to my group with a tutor present, I also contextualised myself and
                        the struggles I had - of which were quite similar in sense, and yet vastly different in
                        experience. I received feedback that suggested I push forward with a character based on myself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the beginning - although the idea was quite tempting, I wondered what would come to be of the
                        blog should I have it centre on me - especially detailing aspects of personal life as I would
                        include members of family and friends as their lives entertwined with mine. Eventually, I
                        compared the pros and cons - and I also asked for the relavant permissions from the people close
                        to me whom I felt would be involved in this idea of mine, and rather than
                        just basing the character on myself, I decided to fully allow the chracter to be me. A student,
                        living in Joburg, in 2020.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have eventual plans for the site itself to be continued for personal use after the course and
                        the creative content details exactly what I would put out going forward.
                        <br>

                            <em>
                                After recieving feedback that there is still a necessary distinction required
                                between the character and the real, I have decided to implement the following
                                changes to the context of my character for the duration of the course:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The character exists in a version of Johannesburg, in the year 2020, where the
                                Corona Virus did not exist as such a major threat in South Africa and therefore, no
                                quarantine is apparent.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The change will reflect in a post in Perspective - detailing how the Corona Virus
                                threat was dealt with swiftly by government. (Will add link soon).

                                <br>
                                Perspective Posts will continue as per usual, with this distinct different in
                                worlds.

                        When designing my wireframes I focused on threee main parts: The homepage, a text based page,
                        and my art/poetry layout.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First, the homepage. While designing the wireframes, the first attempt I can up with is the one
                        below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <center>
                            <a

                            </a>
                        </center>
                        <br>
                        This was a first attempt at my homepage. It would include a lot of boxingof elements, image
                        navigation icons and linkable sections/pieces to my latest updates of each section on my site.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I do not believe this is unachieveable but at the current point, my skills are not up to par and
                        so I revised some areas of the plan. I also noticed that I have a lot of sections, and some
                        works would not show up and so in the next version - which is also thecurrent one I use for my
                        homepage, I added a second sidebar to account for my other written pieces.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <center>

                        <br>
                        <strong>
                            <em>
                                However, although this layout emcompasses all the topic I wish to address, I feel it is
                                very text
                                heavy. Although I would like to eventually revert back to my first wireframe when I have
                                the
                                applicable skills, for now, the next solution would be to impelent the following:
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                </center>
                            </em>
                        </strong>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Next was the text post. Honestly, the only changes made were those that also affect the homepage
                        - such as the nave bar and page titles as you have seen above. The original text posts were
                        meant to styled as below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <center>
                            <a

                        <br>
                        The art/poetry/story posts were meant to be individual pages that were linked to a main index -
                        each work with it's own page as below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <center>
                            <a
                                href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/TheHub/Academics/Images/Wireframes/Wireframe_5.jpg">
                                <img src="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/TheHub/Academics/Images/Wireframes/Wireframe_5.jpg"

                            </a>
                        </center>
                        <br>
                        However, after some consideration. I decided to switch the two. The art and poetry could each be
                        contained to their own collection - and stories would operate as the text posts with an
                        individual page for each story/post.

                        Many of my decisions - especially with the layout of the site were based on my own personal
                        organisational methods, as well as a heavy consideration of my skill levels, and the best way
                        for me to maintain the site.

                        Recently, I added styling to my pages, so that the entire document could be affected instead of
                        me doing each individual paragraph, link or image. That is because I learnt how to.

                        As skills develop so will the page.

                        Moving forward, I am considering implementing a simple pastel colour background to the pages,
                        with different colours for each section. This is an attempt at improving my UI and UX while
                        maintaining the nuances of the character I am developing through the site.
