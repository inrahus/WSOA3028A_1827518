                <p>
                    Briefly described, the Browser Wars refers to an era in which Microsoft and Netscape fought for
                    power in
                    order to determine who would be the one to dominate the market. This
                    period of rapid development defined the browsers we so easily access today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first browser WorldWideWeb was created by Tim Burner-Lee. After he developed this technology,
                    several other HTML readers based on his creation began to pop up. It wasn't until students from the
                    NCSA
                    (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) at the University of Illinois developed "Mosaic",
                    that
                    the idea of what a browser was, changed completely. "Mosaic" included several accessibiliy enhancing
                    features that defined it in the public space. However, after a fallout with the University and
                    several
                    legal issues, the founders of Mosaic Communications Corporation, whicj held "Mosaic" - Andreessen
                    and
                    Jim Clark - renamed the
                    company, Netscape, and the product they offered, based on "Mosaic" that Andreessen had co-developed,
                    was now known as the "Netscape Navigator". Leaving "Mosaic" to the University of Illinois.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The older, "Mosiac" and the new "Netscape Navigator" competed on the market and the short, sweet
                    Mosaic
                    War ended
                    with "Netscape Navigator" dominating the markets and public opinion. Netscape acheived this through
                    cutting down the web page loading time, offering a free inclusive email service, as well as still
                    having
                    all the features that were loved from "Mosaic".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For years Netscape thrived with it's product and the continuous additions of features that
                    prioritised
                    convinience, many of which are still influential today.
