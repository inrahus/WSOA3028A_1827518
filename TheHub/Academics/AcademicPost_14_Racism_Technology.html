                <h4>
                    Racism and Technology.
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                In the podcast, Radical AI - the eighth episode features Ruha Benjamin, an accomplishd author who
                discusses the relations between the dimensions of science, technology and medicine, focusing on the
                relationship between inequity, justice, knowledge and power. In the episode that features her, Benjamin
                elaborates on the relation - and necessity for awareness, of the socio-political within technology
                centred spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the discussion, Benjamin relays that the way we learnt to define racism, versus what racism
                actually is, is an important distinction to make. Benjamin further explains that although there isn't an
                intent of malice behind the structures, developments and laws in place - there is still effect that is
                had, which is in turn racially discriminatory. She exemplifies the issue of drug, and drug enforcement
                penalties whcih affect racial groups in the American context severely differently. The severity allowed
                by the penalties of the drugs - which are reagrdless, more porminent in black societies of America - are
                a way in which the effect of the law, is racist. She goes on the apply a similar example in terms of
                technology and it's advances.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the context of soap dispensers, Benjamin showcases how the near infrared technology used, is
                discrimatory.
                Alhough the technology was developed with good intent, it cannot be denied that because of the nauture
                of the technology - i.e. infrared technology, would only allow the soap to dispense onto lighter skin
                tones becasue darker skin tones, with more melanin, woud absorb more ligh instead of bounce it back and
                triggering the release of soap. Benjamin further goes on to show how it is in the systems like this,
                that reflect the skewness of the data input and the lack of the peope who could address it in the
                process of creation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Benjamin clearly notes that in the circumstances where it is most necessary for representation, there
                is a lack of it. The racism that we are taught exists, but this unintentional divide is furthered by the
                gap present in the developmental stages of these technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how do we fix it?
            </p>
            <p>
                The admittance and realisation thta these divides exist and are a problem, is a necessary step into
                dealing with the problem - you have to acknowledge the lack of POC and particularly black presence in
                these spaces, as a problem.
            </p>
            <p> You also need to individually recognise how is it that you are contributing
                to the problem and how it is you plan to tackle thise individual biases you have. It is the
                responsibility of those in the fields, who occupy the spaces ad positions of power, to be self concious
                and aware of their prejudices and how these
                affect the approach and how the process needs to be altered so that the results cater to all.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is in the moment that we use our innocence as an excuse for our ignorance, that we have accepted the
                systems that are desgined to further emphasis the racial divide between us.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a POC who has herself experienced - and been at the end of a discriminatory ssytem - and used a
                system with such a bias to her advantage, I believe that is is important, in the context that we are
                individually, to acknowledge the biases we have, and that the systems we fact and create will have, so
                that we can lessen the recial divide in technology. There needs to be an allowance of vulnerability and
                an acceptance of one's wrongdoing, and a release of pride, for people to understand and acknowledge the
                systems that simultaneously benifit them, at the cost of the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                There needs to be a sense of active learning abou thtese processes - and as Ruda Benjamin meentioned,
                this means you can't just go around calling everything racist - you need to be able to understand and
                see why it is something with inherently racism effects - and acknowlegde that there is sometimes more
                than just a removal of the system necessary - sometimes the removal of the systemic barrier requires a
                reformation or revisitation of the technology and sources that it is based on.
