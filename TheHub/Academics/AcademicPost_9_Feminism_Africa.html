                    The Importance of Feminism In Africa and African Internet.
                </h4>
            </section>

                    Technology, and the internet in particular, has long been a medium that shapes reality. It is
                    something with the ability to change the very way people interact and communicate - how they see the
                    world and how they are seen in it as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the longest time, the issue of inequal access to the
                    internet has created a platform that is rapidly replicating the supressive reality of the
                    outerweb of today. The internet's ability to be manipulated allows the opression of the African
                    voices and history to continue when it can be used in the opposite effect to allow the introduction
                    of genuine visibilty of the African context and it's diverse nature.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the article published by Sheena Magenya, there is an exploration of how the online space has been
                    used and adapted to further increase and aid the attack on women of colour, and the LGBTQ+ community
                    and the gender non-comforming community. Magyenya explains that the bridging of technolgy with
                    reality has created a space where there is no offline processes to deal with the happenings and
                    doings that occur in the online space - the lack of legislation in African countries reagrding this
                    have shaped the online space as a "safe"space for
                    consequence-less violence that targets these minorities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Feminism in the African context has never been easy. With many cultures stemming from a matriarchal
                    hierarchy, many Africans believe there to be a sense of "Un-Africanness" associated with being a
                    feminist. The President of the African National Women's Organisation, Yejide Orunmila, agrees.
                    Orunmila argues that the ideals of fenimism higly contradict the African natural inclination of
                    struggling together. Orunmila states that it creates a divide among men and women of the continent,
                    changing the fight form that of the colonial opression and capitalist system, to a fight that seeks
                    a sense of validation from the primary, colonial oppressors - who, in fact, where the ones who, with
                    the introduction of slavery, shifted the status of African women from positions of power to
                    positions where they were exploited and the patriarchy was favoured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In comparison however, when met with the same question of feminism being "un-African", Minna Salami,
                    disagrees. Salami acknowledged the issues to do with the colonial powers, and how they have affected
                    the exploitation of women in the African context, but states that comtemporary feminism highlights
                    that the gender roles we find ourselves in are not biological conditions that determine how we
                    behave
                    socially, but rather that we are made to socialise to fulfil said gender roles. The award winning
                    writer furthers her arguement and staes that pre colonial times were not exclusionary of the
                    patriarchal view, and that the current, presnt day patriarchy is responsible for the unrivaled
                    suffering of the female in the African context.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reason that feminism finds itself necessary in the African context, as Minna Salami emphasises,
                    it is more un-African to allow and ignore the current inhumane discriminations of the female in
                    Africa - and thereby also the non-binary minority and the LGBTQ+ communities struggles of similar
                    note as well. By not acknowledging the presence and Africanness of Feminism, we ignore the erasure
                    of African narrative by the very colonisers who systematically opressed and continue to oppress us
                    with the evolution of society on the digital platforms. This is why there is such a necessity for
                    the African Feminist on the internet - namely the African internet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Magenya explains, African Feminists need to take up space on the internet, tell their stroies, th
                    stories of their people, their countries, their cultures - give the persepctive tha has long been
                    ommitted from history, and open up the digital platform for more African women, queers and
                    non-binaries to do the same. With the current state of the world, especially with the current
                    quarantine and the higher chance of radicalisation of ideas through the web because of it - it is
                    most important to use this opportunity to denounce the oppressive reality to manifest and overtake
                    the safe space initally created to educate, communicate and relate.

                    With the beginning of the discourses surrounding the idea of feminism in the African context - and
                    the
                    acknowledgement of both its shortcomings to the context and necessary issues it addresses, it is
                    clear that there must be a claim and representation of feminism and what its ideas represent in the
                    African context compared to both that of the East and the West. Feminism finds itself a global
                    movement, an international form of resistance to the
                    inequalities. And as Salami notes, Africa remains a revolutionary resistance in the world today, and
                    so Feminism is no doubt something very African.
