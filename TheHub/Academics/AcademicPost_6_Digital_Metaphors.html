                <p>
                    Digital Metaphors are one of the ways in which the digital space has become accessible to a larger
                    audience. These terms became a way to convey the complex, abstract ideas of cyber world while also
                    grounding the it into a more real, relatable space - making it easier for people who interact with
                    the digital to grasp the concepts, and a general idea of how they function and what for.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the best examples to use here is: "Cloud".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As described by Hua Hsu, in his article for the New Yorker - the metaphor, "Cloud" is easy to
                    grasp. The concept of data and information being available to us at any given moment, at any given
                    place - wirelessly, is just like that of a cloud that can be seen from anywhere and at (almost)
                    anytime, as it drifts and floats in the sky above us. The same way our data/information drifts and
                    floats in
                    the cloud itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Metaphors are used by relating abstract digital concepts to objects/concepts that the mass majority
                    encounter in their everyday lives. However, it is not always guaranteed that all users will
                    understand the metaphors - especially if the term used is something that they are unaware of in
                    their daily lives. Most terms are developed in a way that users can intuitively understand while
                    some require some prior knowledge of a topic for the user to understand the relevance - for example,
                    a shopping cart.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is a metaphor commonly used in the online shopping realm and refers to the collection of items
                    that you have decided you will purchase. The cart - like a physical one, can be added to, items an
                    also be removed. Additionally most shopping carts display a total price as well as the individual
                    prices of each item. But in order for someone to grasp the basic concept of what this term could
                    possibly een entail, they would have had to interact with a physical shopping cart at some point in
                    their lives.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Someone who has never encountered the object will not have the knowledge to intuitively
                    assume what the shopping cart icon stands for, not what it's potential use could be. The term is
                    lost on the user and their ability to interact with that digital space drasctically decreases. That
                    is an important thing to remember - as pointed out in "Metaphor in Computer Science" by Colburn and
                    Shute - especially as designers who use tools such as digital
                    metaphors, to communicate with our users and define their overall experiences and interactions with
                    what we create. There is always a mix of prior knowledge involved in the user's interaction
                    with the digital metaphor - and we must remember what knowledge is truly classified in society as
                    "common".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Hua Hsu mentions in his piece, "How the Metaphor of “the Cloud” Changed Our
                    Attitude Toward the Internet", the way that digital metaphors have adapted and changed to consider
                    factors - such as the example of the shopping cart - over the years show just how quickly the world
                    is
                    evolving. In their work, Colburn and Shute also mention
                    how metaphors are not new to
                    the world, but they were introduced to the digital space for the same function a metaphor was
                    brought in as a writing tool - to define and ground the abstract in a way that is wholely able to be
                    adapted by society.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Going forward, digital metaphors have the ability to define the digital space to the point where
                    users can interact with the cyber world in a way that is as comfortable to them as the more "real"
                    objects of their daily lives.
