                        Prior to reading this post, I do suggest you take a look at <a
                            href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/TheHub/Academics/AcademicPost_4_Mosaic_War.html">The
                            Mosaic War</a> - as
                        it
                        defines a
                        majority of terms that may be used below, and also gives context to Netscape's origins.
                    </em>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After the Mosaic War, Netscape began to gain traction with the constant development of new features
                    to
                    their browser. Around the time that they were reaching a stable peak, Microsoft and Bill Gates
                    himself, realised the profits that could be gained in the web browser industry. Prior to Netscape's
                    great overtake on the markets, Microsoft had not realised that although they were able to supply
                    home
                    software, they were losing profits because web browsers were sold seperately from
                    operating systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Microsoft first took steps to communicate with Netscape in hopes of merging
                    together and furthering
                    Microsoft's future in web development. However, talks did not end well and eventually Internet
                    Explorer was released by Microsoft. Netscape did not take the release seriously as it did not
                    present an initial threat to the highly developed Netscape Navigator. That was until Bill Gates
                    announced plans of Web Domination on the 7th of December, 1995, and the First Browser War began.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within the following years, Microsoft and Netscape challnged each other, each making minor
                    iterations to their browser with each release, and the other responding with equal or more
                    iterations with theirs. Iterations were released monthly and eventually, as the final 3.0 versions
                    of each browser were released. The standings between the teo were realised on the markets. With
                    Netscape dominating the web browser usage at a major 90%.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, on the 7th of October, 1997 - the tables turned. Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4.0.
                    A web broswer - the first web broswer, to be intergrated into the operating system. People no longer
                    had to seperately purchase web browsers as Microsoft now supplied the buyers of their operating
                    system, with a web browser included.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Microsoft owned 90% of the market when it came to operating systems. By releasing the browser
                    alongside their system, they saw a steady takeover of the web browser market. And by their 5.0
                    version release of Internet Explorer, they owned 60% of the market.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Netscape never recovered from the losses and in when Internet Explorer 6.0 was released in 2001, the
                    First Browser Wars ended. Microsoft theunderdog winner, and Netscape dissolved.
