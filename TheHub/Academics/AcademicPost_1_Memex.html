                    The idea of the "Memex" was first intoduced by Vannevar Bush in his work, <em>"As We May
                        Think".</em>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The conceptual device that Bush described would act as a memory supplement of sorts. Memex being a
                    shortened form for "memory extender". The machine
                    would store information just as a library would. However, it would be extremely fast and fucntion
                    just as memory - like a large interlaced web-where one piece of information could easily lead to
                    another. At the time the idea was wild and fantastical. But with the development of technology,
                    Bush's idea
                    has come to light in the form of: Wikipedia.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In his work, one of the main points discussed for this device encompasses a "linking" mechanic. From
                    the ability to find information to the ability to jump from that information to
                    any
                    possible related information - Wikipedia is the closest implementation of the concept of the
                    "Memex".
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The way the site allows the information to be added to, changed or
                    even removed, really plays into the features described surrounding the concept.On topof that, the
                    main way in which the pages interlink concepts, even by smallmention of a phrase or word, really
                    showcases the way it conveys the "Memex". Idealistically,
                    these features - namely the interlinking function and editing functions - allow the knowledge to be
                    expanded on, but realistically the
                    "Memex", and the way it is implemented in terms of Wikipedia, present us with a double edged sword.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There is a near infinite source of knowledge that can be accessed on an interlinking
                    platform,
                    but the lack of verification as well as the uncontrolled access that people have to alter and
                    add
                    information, leaves the knowledge in a state where we cannot be sure of its viability.
