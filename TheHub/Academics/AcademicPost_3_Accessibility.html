                    #3, The Importance of Accessibility
                </h4>
            </section>

            <section id="PostBody">
                <p>
                    Accessibility refers to the ease of use of something. The ability the item has to be used by
                    everyone. This may be for pure convinience but it often does - and I believe it always should -
                    take
                    into consideration those with disabilities. Over the years,, several features have been
                    implemented
                    to make it easier for people to overcome the barriers that their diabilities create.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An example of this is ARIA. Also known as Accessible Rich Internet Applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Initially ARIA worked in conjunction with HTML4 - through supplementation, the interactions
                    available were passed along to assistive technologies. However in the HTML5 update, there was an
                    intergration of ARIA into the HTML that allowed it to be more comfortably used by developers for
                    all
                    audiences. Alongside this, the use of semantic HTML elements also played a great role.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Often, people who use assistive tech, find it hard to upgrade. They are reluctant because they
                    are
                    afraid of losing the their ability to interact on the internet and with their computers. Good
                    Semantic Markup is something that makes this switch easier for most as it uses the keyboards
                    built
                    in functions to allow interactivity. The code itself is also more legible and therefore
                    understandable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another important factor is just the general use of language you choose. With disabilities,
                    screen
                    readers are some of the most popular ARIA and can easily be stumped by certain written
                    conventions.
                    For example, if one was to list numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 - they would sinply type it as 1 -
                    7,
                    however, screen readers will not see it as one to seven but as one, dash, seven. Simply typing 1
                    to
                    7 would easily be a considerate move for those who use screen readers as it will be read as such
                    accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The use of semantic markup may be better in terms of accesibility for the disabled
                    by use of keyboard funtions, but it also makes it easier for people to read and uderstand what
                    you
                    have done and coded. Another functional role of semantic mark up in terms of accessiblility is
                    that
                    it easier for your work to be found by search engines.
                    <br>
                    At least thats what I understand.
