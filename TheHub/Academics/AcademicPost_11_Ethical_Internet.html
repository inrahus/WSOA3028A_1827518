                <h4>
                    Internet Ethics and Net Neutrality.
                </h4>
            </section>
            Internet ethics is a braod term that anylyses the role of the internet in terms of it's contributions in
            both the positive and negative impacts it has. The concept is entangled into the society we live in, the
            people we are and the lives that we live, defined by issues of access, data and privacy, and he topic of
            today - net neutrality. This specific acpect of the internet ethics concept that explores the equality of
            the internet, specifically the equal treatment of
            data by large corporations (goverment and internet providers) despite factors of content, platform, device
            or user. It calls for these large providers to give the same access to data.
            <br>
            <br>
            However there have been several debates over whether or not this concept should be proritised or even
            legally enforced. Those who opposse this concept believe that allowing content to flow as freely as those in
            support would like, there is a lack of competition between providers. These opposers - often capitilist
            notion should be
            taken in to consideration - where access is charged for in a tier platform, allowing not only for further
            fund generation, but also to encourage innovative methods for broadband expansion. Most points in thsi
            arguement operated in the financial sections of the debate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Those who advocate for the idea of net neutrailty raise issues of the capitalistic system - noting that it
            prevents smaller businesses from entering the market. It would force then to pay extra for equal access of
            their competitors and makes it near impossible to achieve the same or even remotely similar success. It also
            nots that by allowing for net neutrality, there is an equal change for conent creators to be accessed, while
            also promoting the user's freedom of choice to what they would like to access and view. Those who avocate
            for net neutrality not only advocate in terms of the financial sector of the debate, but they also oversee
            aspects of the users and content creators.
            <br>
            <br>
            As said by Evgeny Morozov, "The techonologies we have are a fucntion of power relations - and so are their
            effects". In the case of net neutrality is is clear that opposing it allows for a dractic difference in
            power, not only between the competing internet service providers, but between these said providers and the
            users. It shows how important the aspect of internet ethics is and why it is important to advocate for the
            neutrality of technology and access - allowing it to postively impact our society, our lives and our people,
            giving these aspects the freedom they are entitled.
