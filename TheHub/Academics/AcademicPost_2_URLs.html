                <p>
                    Doing a degree in Digital Art is very interesting. In this particular course, as you can see, we're
                    learning about web design. There's a great focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this particular
                    course - and one of the most fundamental things I had to learnt o undertand was how URLs work, and
                    more importantloy, what they are.
                </p>

                <p>
                    URL. It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Simple. Three words.
                    <br>
                    But what [the fuck] does that mean?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Basically it's how you find something on the web. It's address to a resource. It could lead to
                    anything honestly. A page, a picture, a video. But each URL is unique for each unique resource. The
                    way URLs are shown to the world are dependent on the owener of the web server.
                </p>

                <p>
                    URLs, are pretty complex though. They consist of several parts which are - mostly - necessary. Just
                    like an item in a box in a place in another place and maybe even abother place that you're looking
                    for, you need some vital pieces of information. Using that
                    comparison, I will attempt to explain priefly the parts of a URL that I am aware of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        There are a six main parts:
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Protocol
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <em> http</em>. This isthe method used to transfer data on a computer network. if it its
                        <em>http<strong>S </strong></em> then the method is secure, as compared to just, <em>http</em>.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Domain Name
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is your <em>www.</em> to your <em>.com</em>. Your website. Sometimes people use IP adresses
                        but a domain name is more legible, understandable, and therfore accessible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you want to know a bit more about accesiblility check out my post: <a
                            href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/Home/Academia/Academia_Posts/Academia_Post_2_The_Importance_Of_Accessibilty.html">#2,
                            The Importance of Accessibilty</a>
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Port
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The port is what you need to get through to get access to the resources. Often you don't see
                        these - which doesnt mean they aren't there - but you can think of them as a gate.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Path
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Just like it says - it's the way to the resource. Apparently, this previously had a physical
                        component to it - a physical file on the server. But these days is handled more abstractly.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Parameters
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The parameters are pretty much as the name states to be honest. The rules of the website that
                        the server considers before getting to the resource.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Anchor
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Last but not least, the anchor. It's a bookmark of sorts. It is a particular part/place within
                        the resource. So a particular point in a video or a specifc paragraph in an article.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <p>
                    URLs provide a way for people to interact with the site at an entry level. It is one of the first,
                    key components that they can memorise and type up in any search bar. This is why the idea of
                    semantic [accessible, understandable] URLs and language in general is of great importance to the Web
                    Design Community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Advatgaes of using legible/semantic URLs can include: the ability to easily manipulate them; easier
                    clarity for readers/interacters, as well as making it easier for search engines to identify pages
                    associated with your site.
