                <p>
                    In an era where technology had become a part of our everyday lives, a course like Digital Art - one
                    I find myself in - is not only interesting, but also extremely informative.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In Interactive Media, we study the fundamentals of web design. What HTML, CSS and JavaScript are,
                    how they work and how to implement them. Practical knowledge and practical work. One of the most
                    base level things - as well as one of the sections I found actually very enjoyable - to understand
                    in this particular topic is: URLs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    URL. It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Simple. Three words.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But what does that mean? What does it stand for? Why is it important?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Basically it's how you find something on the web. It's address to a resource. It could lead to
                    anything. A page, a picture, a video. But each URL is unique for each unique resource. The
                    way URLs are shown to the world are dependent on the owner of the web server.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For example, on my site here, I have chosen to implement an box-in-a-box structure for my site to be
                    easily nagivated and easily coded. Each section is a category and in each category lies
                    sub-categories, and so forth and so forth. For more, please see my <a href="">Web Design
                        Choices.</a>
                    <br>
                    However, unlike the simple looking organised method I use, URLs, are pretty complex. They consist of
                    several parts which are
                    <em>- mostly - </em>
                    necessary. Just
                    Just like an item, that's in a box... In a bigger box, in the cupboard, of a mother's room, of the
                    upstairs of
                    the house, in the house on the corner of the street.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        There are a six main parts of a URL:
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Protocol
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <em> http</em>. This is the method used to transfer data on a computer network. if it its
                        <em>http<strong>S </strong></em> then the method is secure, as compared to just, <em>http</em>.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Domain Name
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is your <em>www.</em> to your <em>.com</em>. Your website. Sometimes people use IP adresses
                        but a domain name is more legible, understandable, and therfore accessible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you want to know a bit more about accesiblility check out my post: <a
                            3href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/Home/Academia/Academia_Posts/AcademicPost_3_Accessibility.html">#3,
                            The Importance of Accessibilty</a>
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Port
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The port is what you need to get through to get access to the resources. Often you don't see
                        these - which doesnt mean they aren't there - but you can think of them as a gate.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Path
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Just like it says - it's the way to the resource. Apparently, this previously had a physical
                        component to it - a physical file on the server. But these days is handled more abstractly.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Parameters
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The parameters are pretty much as the name states to be honest. The rules of the website that
                        the server considers before getting to the resource.
                    </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt>
                        <strong>
                            Anchor
                        </strong>
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Last but not least, the anchor. It's a bookmark of sorts. It is a particular part/place within
                        the resource. So a particular point in a video or a specifc paragraph in an article.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <p>
                    URLs provide a way for people to interact with the site at an entry level. It is one of the first,
                    key components that they can memorise and type up in any search bar. This is why the idea of
                    semantic (accessible/understandable) URLs and language in general, is of great importance to the Web
                    Design Community.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Advantages of using legible/semantic URLs can include: the ability to easily manipulate them; easier
                    clarity for readers/interacters, as well as making it easier for search engines to identify pages
                    associated with your site.
