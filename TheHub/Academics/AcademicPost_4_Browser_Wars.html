                <p>
                    The Browser Wars are really funny. And so unsatisfying really. Very, very, very, <em>petty</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning shall we?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once upon a time there was a man named Tim (Berners-Lee, but we'll call him Tim, like any developer
                    would
                    prefer). He created the first web browser. He called it the WorldWideWeb. As
                    the years went on, he decided to change the name. First to Nexus, and from Nexus to NeXTstep.
                    Because of Tim's amazing discovery. Or more his amazing invention rather, many others realised the
                    potential that his great masterpiece held, and so, they began to create their own - but mostly based
                    on his version. After the brief Mosaic War - which i won't be discussing, but if you're interested
                    here's a link : Mosaic Wars - the WorldWideWeb became known as Netscape Navigator. </p>

                <p>
                    And so it began. The First Browser War. The War of 1995 (to 2001).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Netscape Navigator was ahead of the game. Even with the existence of several other browsers,
                    Netscape remained the most widely used browser. Then one day, Microsoft created Internet Explorer
                    2.0. And Internet Explorer 2.0 was free for all Windows users. And the war began.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rapid releases of versions of each browser were being released. Companies followed in the steps of
                    Internet Explorer and release theirs for free. JavaScript was enhanced. Others and Netscape did not.
                    They instead provided
                    package deals that included an email client, downloads manager and even an HTML editor. There was
                    much more than this obviously and they were dubbed, "Internet Suites".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Basically, they kept on trying to outdo each other. And it went on for years. They tried to sway the
                    public with their features and prices and their innovation. The war even went as far as to take it
                    onto the physical plan - where they had large 3D modelled logos made and put up to celebrate each
                    release and innovative idea they came up with.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But Microsoft won. Sadly. It was depressing really. It mostly had to do with a lot of ecomonic
                    reasons and timing of release - but yeah, Gates won. At a price of a lot of legal fees and all that
                    but he won. He won that war.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This turned out a lot sadder than I thought it would. I was really rooting for Netscape, you know?
                    But it is what it is I guess.
                    <br>
