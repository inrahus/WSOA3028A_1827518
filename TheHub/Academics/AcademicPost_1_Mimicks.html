                    #1, Reflection on the "Mimicks"
                </h4>
            </section>

            <section id="PostBody">
                <p>
                    The "Mimicks" refer quite directly to the internet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Linking" is present as a main conceptual point in the work and it is something with a heavy
                    presence in today's society - especially when it comes to sharing information on a digital
                    platform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although, fairly speaking, the best/most appropriate reflection of the "Mimicks" lie within
                    Wikipedia. From the ability to find information to the ability to jump from that informaion to
                    any
                    possible related information. The way the site allows the information to be added to, changed or
                    even removed, really plays into the features described surrounding the concept of "Mimicks".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Idealistically, these features allow the knowledge to be expanded on, but realistically the
                    "Mimicks" present us with a double edged sword.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sure, there is a near infinite source of knowledge that can be accessed on an interlinking
                    platform,
                    but the lack of verification as well as the uncontrolled access that people have to alter and
                    add
                    information, leaves the knowledge in a state where we cannot be sure of its viability.
                </p>
