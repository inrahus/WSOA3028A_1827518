            <p>
                UX, or User Experience, is a subjective result that is obtained when a person interacts with an object
                or artifact. There are three main aspects to a UX. First, the object/artifact that is interacted with.
                Second, the user themselves - their expectations, desires and needs have an influence over the
                experience. And thirdly, the context in which the user and the object engage with each other.
                <br>
                <br>
                Each of these aspects are critically viewed in the eyes of companies when creating a product or offering
                a service, and over time, the need to appeal the user - mostly focusing on their desires and needs, has
                become the top priority in development today. These days, products and services created take heavily
                into account the UX - however, when trying to please the masses of uses, there are outlying factors -
                ethical factors that are often ignored, forgotten or just seen as unimportant. One of such factors -
                especially in the areas of mass produced objects/artifacts is deleption of privacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                Living in the digital age that we do, privacy on the web is a constant topic and a constant boundary
                tested by the applications we use on the daily. Evert ytime we downlard an app, we are asked permission.
                We are constantly bonbarded with having to allow access to parts of our lives what would otherwise be
                private - with the notion that, by giving permission, those we are giving permission to, do not abuse
                the access and trust we have given them.
                <br>
                <br>
                We cannot deny that sometimes the permissions we give do have a positive aspect. For example, remote
                monitoring technology. Allowing monitoring access, of ourselves and even homes - it serves a great
                purpose in the medical industry - making it easier for doctors
                to check on patients, and coserve both their time and stamina. It also helps everyday homes and
                businesses - allowing for better security and reassurance. But, as stated by Bill Griibbons as he
                discussed the ethics of UX, "With each new capability comes added consequences."
                <br>
                <br>
                There are 3 main principles defined by Chris Kiess as he discusses the classifications of ethical UX
                design. They are: Benevolent Intent, Existential Values, and Ill/Misdirected Intent. The one I find most
                interesting is Ill or Misdirected Intent - where other intentions are placed above the user. This often
                results when the business aspects are too heavily prioritised, but there is am important note as to how
                this is classified.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Kiess says, it is
                <strong>
                    the moment that we decide to cause harm, exploit to the user - the moment the
                    product is difficult for the user to engage with because we have prioritised another aspect - that
                    we
                    have crossed the line as designers.
                </strong>
