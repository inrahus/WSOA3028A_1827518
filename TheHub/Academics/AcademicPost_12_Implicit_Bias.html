                <h4>
                    Reflecting on the Race Implicit Bias Test.
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                The Project Implicit is a NPO (non profit organisation) that allows for international collaboration
                between researcher who wish to explore implicit social cognition, or mor simply: "thoughts and feelings
                outside of conscious awareness and control". It allows for the edication of the public in terms of
                hidden biases and as a secondary objective, provides a virtual lab of data collection in the digital
                space.
                <br>
                <br>
                I wil specifically be taking the Race Implicit Association Test and reflecting on the results. This test
                requires the the taker of the test tim distinguish the faces of people that are of European and African
                descent. The test has a general conclusion - that most Americans have an automatic preference for white
                over black. I believe that because of my unique South African context, that my results will most likely
                lean in the opposite to that of the general American public.
                <br>
                <br>
                One issue I have already identified in the description of the test, is that although it encompasses the
                idea of race - it intially present the spectrum as two distinct binaries, ignoring the inclusion of
                other race, and thereby contributing to the exclusion of such. It is an issue I find very prevelant,
                especially from a backgorund that is neither black or white.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Race Task when clicked on, furhter explains that the test will consist of sorting images and words
                into groups at a rapid pace. There are questions that help contextualise you as a test taker that
                pertain
                to your beliefs, attitudes, opinions and demographic.
                <br>
                <br>
                The result of my test is, "No automatic preference between Black and White people".
                <br>
                <br>
                I find this to be rather surprising. I have always felt that I have had a somewhat personal bias against
                the white community because of of the racial history of the the country I both live and was raised in,
                alongside several racially charged encounters where I was discriminated against by white people. I also
                felt that my circle of friends, which are predominately people of colour, would also establish a bias
                where I would automatically prefer Black over White. I also realise that this can be taken in the more
                negative where there is a lack of automatic association to either because of my own racial context that
                shows no current direct association to either.
                <br>
                I - since learning about the importance of intersectionality and justice, have been conciously aware of
                this
                bias. I believe this result shows that concious awareness plays a huge part in my views of equality, and
                despite my personal feelings of my bias, I respond in a neutral manner despite all the factors mentions
                above. I am proud of my result and will continue to pursue a state where my bias is neutral.
