                    you make me happy when skies are grey.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    it's alright when there's sunshine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    it's alright.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    and when there isn't and
                    <br>
                    the storms rage on and the winds blow me from where i stand and
                    <br>
                    the rain insists on blinding my vision,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    i wander.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    i wander, wonder,
                    <br>
                    wait.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the wind that is blowing
                    <br>
                    me back, away
                    <br>
                    from you -
                    <br>
                    is it worth fighting?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    the rain,
                    <br>
                    blinding me, is it just me
                    <br>
                    crying?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I wonder if maybe you're better off without me on these days.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I know you're better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I know you deserve better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    maybe, maybe
                    <br>
                    i should know better.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    but it's alright
                    <br>
                    when there's sunshine.

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    you'd do it again because

                    it was love.
