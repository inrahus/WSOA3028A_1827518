    <article id="story - TO BE RECODED">

        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I don’t like him.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I rolled my eyes and let myself fall back onto the bed. “What do you mean you
            “don’t like him”?” I asked.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Just.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I heaved a breath and turned on my side to face my friend who was seated on the
            carpet.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Ari and I had been friends for 6 years. Since high school. And now we were
            roommates at university. Ari always
            had a good sixth sense when it came to people, but honestly, I really wish she didn’t.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I turned to face the ceiling again and asked aloud, “Why, Ari?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I don’t know what it is yet Demitri,” she said stoically, “I just don’t think
            he’s a good person.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I was upset. Tyrene seemed to me like such a nice person. Everyone in my department knew him, and no one had
            any
            issues with him. He was the front runner in his course and he always looked good. In other words, the man
            just
            literally embodied perfection. That’s why my first-year crush on him had carried over into second year and
            from
            there into third. But then again, Ari was rarely ever wrong. Even when she was wrong, she always ended up
            being
            right.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Isn’t it the first time he’s spoken to you?” Ari asked, pushing the silence away.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “No.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “No?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “It’s not like we never spoke before. We just speak some more now.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I didn’t know that.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Which part?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “That you guys spoke before.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Are you mad?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “No, why? Do I sound it?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Yes. You sound angry with me,” I said, moving my forearm over my eyes. I was
            still annoyed. Ari was
            never the
            type to lie, and her truths always came immediately.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I remember in high school when we first met. She had just transferred in and I was asked to show her
            around. I
            had a friend at the time named Benji, he was two years above me and we had been friends since I started
            high
            school. Ari had looked at us with a sharp dislike when we were introduced. I had wondered what we had
            done to
            make her dislike us already. Later when we were alone, Ari told me that Benji seemed very untrustworthy.
            I
            didn’t believe her, of course, until I overheard him later that week telling someone that he was only
            friends
            with me, because he really wanted to – and I quote, “tap that when the time comes”. It had hurt. It hurt
            even
            more when I walked into class and sat next to her and told her she was right.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Suddenly my arm lifted, and I was pulled out of the memory. Ari gazed over me; her eyebrows furrowed and
            her
            lips tight. “I’m not angry with you Demi,” she said softly, “I’m worried.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I felt weird. I didn’t always know what to do with Ari’s care, especially since she didn’t really care
            about
            many things. Being one of those few things meant that there was a weight I needed to pull. A standard
            that I
            reached and had to maintain.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            There was chime from my bedside table and I looked to see my phone screen lit up. I reached for the
            device as
            Ari stepped away and sat back down on the rug.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Who is it?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I looked to her and then back at the screen. It was him. Tyrene. Asking me out on a date. For Friday.
            This
            Friday. Friday, as in tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I unlocked the phone and typed out my response. I hesitated to send it and looked
            up to see Ari staring
            at me. I
            breathed, sent the message and fell back onto the bed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Demi, who – “
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I have group work,” I interrupted, “And I’ll be late tomorrow evening because we’re going to someone’s
            place to
            work on it.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            She didn’t respond to me and I didn’t bother to break the silence. Ari knew I was lying. Right now, I
            didn’t
            care. I slumped off the bed and made my way to my closet to look at what clothes I could wear for
            tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Maybe my choice was wrong and maybe it was selfish, but then again just maybe – just this one time, Ari
            would be
            wrong.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            *****
        </p>
        <br>

        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “It’s going well,” I said.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I’m glad,” said Ari.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Are you sure?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I know I don’t sound it, but I am. I am glad that your date is going well. I’m just a bit tired Demi.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Alright,” I said, “I need to go, he’s coming back. I’ll call you later.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I ended the call with Ari and laid my phone face down on the table.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I had just got back from classes all day to get ready for the date. When I looked to my bed, there
            was a
            dress
            there. A very beautiful, soft pink floral one with a note. And it read that the dress was from Demi.
            And
            that
            she knew I was lying and that she didn’t want things to be that way between us. So, she bought me
            this
            dress for
            my date. When I was dressed an hour later and ready to leave, she had walked in and her eyes lit up
            the
            same way
            they lit up when we went to our Farewell Ball in our last year of high school.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “You are beautiful Demitri,” Ari said to me, “You’re beautiful and I hope he can see all of that
            beautiful that
            you have.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I looked up at Tyrene and smiled.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Do I have something on my face?” he asked jokingly.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “No, you’re just handsome.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            He chuckled and sat down. And then we spoke. And we spoke some more. And then we ate and we spoke
            and we
            laughed
            and we had fun. At the end of it all, he took me back to my room at my residence.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I walk from the door to my bed in the dark when the lights suddenly came on. I turned my head and I
            saw
            Ari
            sitting slouched on her bed.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Hi,” I said.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Hey,” she responded tired, “Are you alright?”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I’m fine Ari,” I said with a smile.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I see… It went well then?’”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Yes. It went very well.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            There was silence and when I looked at Ari she just looking at me. I hated it. I hated it because I
            knew
            that
            she knew. When she looked down and then back up at me I wondered if maybe – just maybe she was like
            that
            because
            she felt ashamed of what she had said about Tyrene. I wondered if maybe there was another reason why
            she
            seemed
            so sad and so far away.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “I’m glad you’re back safe,” she said softly.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I didn’t respond.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Did he like the dress?” she asked.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Yes. He said it was beautiful.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            She huffed a smile and her body leaned down onto her pillows and I looked to the clock. It was
            midnight
            and I
            had left at four. Had she been waiting all this time? Why?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Thank you, Ari,” I said softly, “For the dress.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            “Anytime,” she yawned, “Anything for you Demi.”
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I walked over to her bed where the light switches were and switched them off. Then I looked down at
            her
            and I
            kissed her forehead. She smiled and touched my face and I could feel the tears well up and I turned
            away.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">I went to my wardrobe and I took my pyjamas and the shower speaker. Then I went
            back to the entrance
            and
            picked
            up my phone from the small table and went to the bathroom. I turned on the shower and set up my
            music.
            Then I
            took off my clothes and stepped inside. Then, I cried. I cried until there was no more energy left
            in me
            to cry.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I got out of the shower and dried myself. I did my routine, switched off the music and dressed to go
            to
            bed. As
            I was closing the door, I looked at myself in the mirror.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            My eyes were red and my under-eyes were dark and puffed. My hair was tied into a bird’s nest of
            curls
            and my
            dark skin was tainted with a deep pink undertone from where the tears has been streaming down my
            face.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            <em>Pitiful.</em> That’s what I looked like. That’s what I was.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I closed the door and I put my things away. I threw the dress Ari got me for the
            date into the
            washing
            basket
            and got myself beneath my bed sheets and closed my eyes.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Tyrene had said that I was very beautiful. And he had said that he loved how I thought about the
            world
            and how I
            thought about people. He said many things tonight. We did many things tonight.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Tyrene saw my laughter at the table and heard my cries of pleasure in the backseat. He saw my
            finessed
            table
            manners and smiled at the bruises on my breasts from his teeth. He saw the way I delicately brushed
            his
            hand as
            we sat across each other and flirted, and he felt how I gripped and scratched his back as he put all
            of
            him in
            and against me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <center>
                <em>Fuck Demitri, what am I going to tell my girlfriend about this?</em>
            </center>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            My eyes opened and I turned to face Ari. She was asleep. Sound asleep. But I was awake.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I watched Ari as she slept, and I wondered if maybe she tried to hold all my sadness away from me.
            For
            the
            longest time, there were little sprays along the way. Just enough to dampen me, but there was always
            –
            always,
            enough light for me to see the rainbow. The sprays seemed to slip out as easily as Ari’s truths. But
            now, I was
            in the middle of a hurricane. There was so much thunder and lightning and there were only remnants
            of
            sunshine
            beneath the dark, dark clouds.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            My mother always said that the rains were blessings. That downpours and storms meant growth and
            change
            and joy.
            That there would always be so much more after the water fell down and left its temporary stain on
            us.
            But she
            never told me about the floods. About the shear pain of the cascades. She never told me how to deal
            with
            the
            drowning.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            I realised then as I laid in the bed and watched Ari’s chest rise and fall - that if I chose to go
            outside, I
            would have to deal with the weather. And I would have to deal with that weather all by myself now.
