                <p>
                    I had a fight with my friend this week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It happened the day before I went to see my therapist. And being as I am, I spoke to her about it -
                    we were weighting out the pros and cons and for a split second, I was in another place.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this generation, so many of us already know/consider/understand so much. We know why we're sad or
                    anxious, depressed, down or scared/ We just don't know how to deal with it really.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On day one my therapist told me that most of her job was to just tell me what I had said to her, but
                    in different words. In different ways. In light of changing my perspective on the situations I
                    encountered and would encounter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But she never got around to that. By the time a half hour had gone by and I had laid out the whole
                    situation, from what started it, to his response - my reaction to the response and every possible
                    reason why he said what he said and didn't listen to me. She ended up teaching me how to stop
                    jumping to conclusions where I blamed myself. It was helpful. I realised I jumped straight to self
                    blame because it was the easier thing for me to just take resposibilty and deal with the negatives
                    than give it to someone else to deal with themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And funny enough, if there's one thing I don't like, it's the inability to try to understand
                    someone else. So from my
                    side, I really do believe I saw where he was comiong from - but he refused to see my side, because
                    it
                    wasn't the same as his perspective (for the first time in our friendship). It was frustrating, and
                    it was hurtful, especially for a topic so close to my heart.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, when I saw my friend again, a few days ago. He apologised. I was taken aback as he is
                    quite stubborn and has not apologised or admitted his wrongs - EVER - before.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I did ask him if I had said or done anything that he felt I should apologise for, and he just shook
                    his head, and just as my therapist said to me too, "You didn't do anything wrong."
                </p>

                <p>
                    What I'm trying to say here is one, therapy is good. It's helping me, and that's the only person I
                    can speak for. Two, not everything that goes
                    wrong is your fault nor is it always something <i>you've</i> done wrong. Three, people can change.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And four. Understanding people. Trying to understand people - and accepting them, is
                    important. And that means giving them a change to be wrong, see that they're wrong, and change. Not
                    make excuses. Not and self blame.
