                    Last year was rough.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Not to say the threat of a global pandemic being a constnt fear isn't huge or anything - but - 2019.
                    was full of lessons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Looking back, I saw just now many were associated with different parts of Joburg.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First was Braamfontein. The student residence central. The place of South Points, East Campus, WAM
                    and Chicken Licken. THE place. The place that I first moved out of home to. The place that I moved
                    into with my friend. The place I started realising just who I was. What it meani to be alone and be
                    okay with being alone, what it meant to be independent and what it meant - truly, to take care.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The place that my friend first broke my heart. Where she doubted me and my actions, where she kicked
                    me out of the room to spend two hours crying in the arms of a boy she loved because she couldn't be
                    vulnerable if it wasn't a man who was going to hurt her.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Braam. Where I first downloaded dating apps and where I ordered takeout 5 times a week when I had
                    saved up
                    and couldn't be bothered to take out a dish. Where I smoked weed for the first time and got high
                    with someone who is now
                    one of my best friends. Where I had a deep conversation about ice and the importance of mukbangs.
                    Where I played Naruto and met friends who made me feel like studying was fun. A place where I felt
                    like I
                    belonged for the first time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe... Maybe it wasn't that rough after all I guess.
