                    That's what my friend got told by the guy she likes - the guy that she is currently dating, the guy
                    that doesn't seem to undertand the concept of depression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe it's because I come from a place where I dealt with those negative emotions, and my
                    persepctive is obviously different - but i find that to be very narrow minded and dismissive and
                    just plain, <em> mean.</em>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When she told me this, I explained how I viewed her and her depression.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To me, it's a state. It is a place where you are at. And its a place that makes you feel and think
                    in a lower space than normal.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It's like looking at a horizon. The sky meets the sea meets the sand. And you should be looking at
                    where the sun meets the sea, right? But you can't. You're struggling to acknowledge that it's there
                    because you can only really see that the sand meets the water. Sometimes you look up and you see
                    that horizon, and you think, <em>Huh, that's pretty great"</em>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But there's things happening around
                    you, and sometimes inside you, that keep pushing you to rememeber that the sand meets the sea. And
                    you can rememeber and experience the view of the horizon every now and then, but you're usually used
                    to, and often still looking down at where the sand and the sea meet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Okay, maybe I didn't say it exactly like that, but I'm sure you get the picture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The point is. I know that she is trying her best, despite the things that are happening in and
                    around her, to look up and see the horizon. To see the beautiful meeting of blue and orange, when
                    everything is telling her it is only blue and the dull colour of sand.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And to me, that effort is a
                    choice.
                    <br>
                    She is actively choosing to try when everything is telling her not to. She is trying <em>so
                        hard</em>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>
                        <strong>
                            So is she really choosing to be sad?
                        </strong>
                    </em>
