                    The life of fast food and restaurant searching escapes no student. Whether you're looking for the
                    next meal, a date spot, a place to go vibe with your friends or even a place to eat out with your
                    family that results in you and your brother having at the chefs because you've been watching a whole
                    lot of MKR (My Kitchen Rules) and Masterchef and you know EXACTLY why this steaK isn'T mediUM RaRE!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But yes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I guess I never really had a tough time looking for fome good places to eat. But I guess sometimes
                    it's more than the food. It's the budget. The Student Budget.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of us are really lucky. Affording to go to a restaurant and sit, eat and split the bill is a
                    simple thing for us. Maybe even taking turns to cover the whole thing! But sometimes you have to be
                    comsiderate. Remember that we don't all have the same budget and means, and that some of us are
                    trying to save for more than just our next brunch at Tasha's (which is a fucking rip off and the
                    last brealfact place I'd ever do to - like no, I don't like Wimpy either but Wimpy will see me
                    before that inexcusable piece of overpriced unsalted trash they call food).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So here, is a small list of places to try out and go to with your friends, family or you know, by
                    yourself, so you can enjoy your food aloNE without anyone asking for "just a BITE" (I mean me, me
                    asking for a bite...).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First we have the very budget friendly. The take outs. The sometimes we sit and eat her but usually
                    ordering is more than enough you know?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Chicken Licken.
                    <br>
                    Mc Donald's.
                    <br>
                    Roman's Pizza or Debonairs (My personal favourite) or Pizza Hut (but maybe not the Braam side
                    one...)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each of these is usally a favourite because you can get something for any amount of money that
                    anyoen can or wants to contribute. Definitely the best after a huge week of assignments. Get the
                    squad together, get the funds together and chill and chow!
                    <br>
                    (Also, Chicken Licken after a high?? Beautiful... If not that, nuggets on nuggets from McD's - but
                    you know, we all know this...)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next we have your on campus treats. There are three sit down places I really recommend. And in order
                    of budget, they are:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Cafe at the Origins Centre.
                    <br>
                    WAM (Wits Art Museum)
                    <br>
                    Olives and Plates
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each of these is more a restaurant but even if it's just a coffee, they are definitely a different
                    level. I prefer the Cafe at Origins (although I'm sure it has a proper name but we all just call it
                    Origins tbh) because the menu is a bit more neutral, it has some simple snack dishes, full meals and
                    some classical South African favourites (bunnychow). WAM is nicer for pasteries and snacks I think
                    but their buffet measure your plate meals can be really nice and cost officent if you know what to
                    take. They;re supplied by 0 and it leads me to - Olives and Plates, the bougie restaurant on campus.
                    A place you could even take your parents to, hold meetings and even take your friend out for their
                    birthday aha, nudge nudge...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But I would like to give a special mention to:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kara Nichas
                    <br>
                    The only fully fasting and vegetarian friendly place on campus. Definitely don't recommend you base
                    your perception of briyani on this place but you have to hand it to them when it comes to complete
                    afforability, and quality for money. Definitely some of the best chilli bites I've had at such a
                    mass produced level, and some good snacks there too. Any day can be rough, but Kara Nicha's is there
                    for you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another local Braam favourite, for those who miss their traditiona African dishes (namely Mogodu or
                    tripe) is African Cuisine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This place does their own free delivery and supply or classic chip and roll favourites, a taste of
                    some traditional South African dishes, and some really, really tasty barbequed meat. The best part
                    is that is really your local authentic corner store that supplies you with the favourites we all
                    know and love. A plac that we can all pitch in to order from (and you can just WhatsApp them, my
                    dear introverts).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kinda hungry now, probably gonna cook though - can't let this mince go to waste.
