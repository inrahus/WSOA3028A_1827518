                    I've been listening to quite a few different genres of music lately. My mom says it's because of my
                    relationship. My best friend says it's cause I'm happier. My brother says jack shit has changed and
                    I still listen to fucking sad music. I would like to say, that not a single one of these is false.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I wanted to share some of my music tastes. And well, this is MY blog. So what better place to share
                    my personal tastes and opinions...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first song is:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have always been a huge fan of Taylor Swift. Since her first album when I was nine, through and
                    through. I've always found her to be one of my idols. Someone I looked up to and respect. Someone I
                    wanted to be like - an image of sophistication and still someone so loud with their own creativity
                    and thoughts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I never really thought to much about why I like the song, but what I do know, is that I have do tend
                    to like this king of music that expresses a feeling of detactement and sexual tension in a very
                    industrial pop manner. I guess another example would be:
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media">
                    </iframe>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Yes. The entire album. Bandlands by Halsey. I few top favourites would be Coming Down, Ghost,
                    Gasoline and Walk the Line. This was actually a throwback. I first listened to Halsey when grappling
                    with my sexuality. She was not only a bisexual icon but the fact that she was mixed and bisexual was
                    something I really identified with. I really appreacatted that there was someone like me -
                    especially when I felt it was so hard to find some form of relation. Not to mention the discovery of
                    sexual freedom, and the whole idea of what sex means for the world, for different people and
                    different lifestyles. But that's a post for another day...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next we have:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4NFD9ea0uH0MtoC30yNYE1" width="300" height="380"
                        frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media">
                    </iframe>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So this is quite a different part of my playlist. Something that my best friend, my boyfriend and my
                    mother and I all really like. This beautiful relaxed RNB vibe of music. A beautiful mellow song. I
                    guess you could say it is one of the songs I really would never have really found if I wasn't in a
                    relationship (so thank you bastard).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Actually it reminds me of this one song I really quite like! It's old, a classic really:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4BfRDZLIiznSnwU7DdDL9N" width="300" height="380"
                        frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media">
                    </iframe>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Honestly. From the day I knew this song off by heart, I should have known that I was queer. But yes,
                    Valerie, by tHE quEEN herself, Any Winehouse. A lovely song overall. I love the vibes, something
                    that reminds me of some good times dancing in the living room with my parents and my brother - even
                    dancing in my dorm room as I cleaned up on a good off day... Hehehe...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This was actually really fun. I'm definitely gonna do this again...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hope you enjoy these!
                    <br>
