                <p>
                    Hey peoplewho still actually read this site's posts it'sbeen quite a while.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'd like to blame it on the wine, anxiety and general lack of motivation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But today, I come bringing great news (that you would have already heard).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    About a week ago, a few people came back from Italy and tested positive for COVID-19 - but luckily,
                    there was already the testing implemented at out airports that occured immediately after landing and
                    they were caught and quarantined on site. There's been no infections in our country so far except
                    for that
                    incident, but there's no international travel allowed. I mean, it's better than what's happening all
                    around Europe lately and not to mention the Americas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But it's nice to know!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It doesn't seem like university will be closing, I'll be staying at res and life here in
                    Johannesburg, South Africa
                    seems like it's going to continue as normal for now. But you never really know what could happen...
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But as it stands - I'd like to thank the government (especially Cyril-Mama (Mama = Uncle)), our
                    amazing president for
                    protecting us from the shit storm pandemic we had coming our way.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, Cyril-Mama, we ask to move onto the countries debt issues and housing provisions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    May the odds ever be in our favour, in South Africa, our land...
