                    "In two weeks, someone could make you feel what someone in two years couldn't."

                <p>
                    I recently got into a relationship. Things are going really well. Like <em> really, really
                        <strong>
                            really
                        </strong>
                        well.</em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so, I was worried. You know, like any human who's a "bornfree" would be. Worried about, <em> The
                        Fuckening.</em>
                    So like any other sensible human, I told my best friend about it. And she just looked at me. Like
                    stared. And I was like,"Is there something on my face? Is there like a pimple...?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said - and I kid you not - in a fully direct and stern tone,"Someone could make you feel in
                    these two weeks that y'all have had together what someone couldn't make you feel in two years."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I obviously rolled my eyes and sighed because who the fuck does she think she is using
                    Instagram/Twitter/Tumblr quotes on me like that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway, I didn't think about it too much, but after being isolated in my single dorm room for long
                    enough, I guess the relevance does stand here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I've never been the most optimistic, or the most expressive of my fear and thoughts. But
                    maybe it's a good opportunity to try and see where and how things go? This guy is pretty fucking
                    amazing for someone I've looked at romantically for two weeks, you know. But we'll see what happens
                    - and I'll tell you what happens, if anything does even happen...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Either way, it still begs the question - does time really make a huge difference?
