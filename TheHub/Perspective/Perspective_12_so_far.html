                    Looking back, 2020 has been so wild already. It feels like it's been almost three years in one. I
                    got into a relationship, and I watched my best frined fall in love too. I saw my friends thrive as
                    artists and I saw the world fall apart with a pandemic and I was shocked when my own country was
                    able to hold it together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than anything, especially after last year, I was so surprised that I got a chance to be this
                    happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I've decided to share some of my favourite memories of the year so far... And tell you a bit
                    about them!!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This was my first date. With my boyfriend. We met last year during exams, but we really got to know
                    each other earlier this year... We went to Rocomamas! He had a cocktail and I had a beer, and after
                    that we went to watch a movie together. We've been dating for four months now and we get along
                    really well...
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's one of the best things that's ever happened to me... And he makes me so happy :)
                </p>

                <p>
                    This next one was actually recently!! We went out to a house party and I caught this really
                    beautiful image of my frined as we were all gearing up to leave. He's always had such an amazing
                    aesthetic and I always admired him for being so cofident about it!
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    I think this is one o the most beautiful images I've ever taken - and I think it speaks to my
                    fined's beauty as well honestly... It was a great night overall - we all got back to res safe, but,
                    we were wasTED. :D
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    This next one was around April. We were... A little... Let's just say we had places to be but
                    instead we were here:
                </p>

                        alt="Image of my closest friends as we sat on a field">
                </p>
                <p>
                    My boyfriend actually took this picture of us! These are my closest and best friends. I love them so
                    much!! On the far left is Bongi, she and I have been friends for over seven years and I love her to
                    bits. Next to her is Ravi and to the right is Zee - I met the two of them when I tarted Uni and
                    we've been joint at the hip since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They're my partners in crime and the people I go to first when somethings wrong. I love them. And I
                    know they love me too...
                </p>
                <p>
                    This actually reminded me of another day we went out to see an exhibit!!
                </p>
                <p>

                        alt="Image of my two friend and I as we wait for company to go to the art museum for an exhibit">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zee wasn't with us this day, but it was beautiful! We walked around with some of the other people in
                    our squad and got to have really nice conversations about ht eexhibit. It's something we do every
                    time a new one pops up at the Museums around Braam, but mostly we go to the ones at our University's
                    museum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I just think I've had so much fun this year...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can't image what we would have done if the pandemic hit us.. All of thse wouldn't exist? Just like
                    that???
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm glad. I'm glad to be here. With thee people... They're amazing... And they make me so happy.. :)
