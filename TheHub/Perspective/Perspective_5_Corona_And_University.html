                <h4>
                    corona and university.
                </h4>
            </section>
            <p>
                Recently, there's been a lot of news surrounding the outbreak of a new virus in that seems to have
                originated in the East - so far here in South Africa, things seem pretty calm. There's been some take of
                preventive measures, and the goverment saying that they're going to do the legal things to protect us,
                but honestly. it wasn't til our lecturer sat us down to discuss what a the effects of a potential
                pandemic could have on our country. On our studies. Our families... On Us.
                <br>
                <br>
                There was a lot of talk on what would happen - learning wise, university-wide. There was one thing they
                said that really was nice to hear, and that was that they'd do whatever they could to rotect us should
                it happen that the pandemic reaches our country.
                <br>
                <br>
                OFten times I find my lecturers and tutors at this institute not all there - quite lost... But if
                there's one thing I can say abou them (...well, most of them), is that I know they only want the best
                for us. With this particular course, I say that confidently.
                <br>
                <br>
                Honestly, as much as I am one to discuss all the implications that such a tpoic could have, and all
                possible scenarios, the one thing I remember thinking that day, was that sometimes our fears take over a
                bit too much. And honestly, why should they? The more fear, the more panic, the more irrationality.
                <br>
                <br>
                So sometimes, we all need a good bt of sense. Someone to smack us in the face and say, "Get your shit
                together!", and sometimes we need someone, like my lecturer, to remind you that it's okay. It is okay.
                It was okay, and it will be okay.
                <br>
                <br>
                And that should be more than enough - being okay.
