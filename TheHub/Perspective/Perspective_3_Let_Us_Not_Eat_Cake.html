                    So my friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, another one of my friends and I went out to get some
                    coffee. It was my friend and her boyfriend's one month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure by now most of you would have guessed that this friend in the relationship who's
                    anniversary it was, is the same friend from <a
                        href="https://inrahus.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827518/TheHub/Perspective/Perspective_1_Sadness_Is_A_Choice.html">"sometimes
                        i feel like you choose to be sad" </a>. If not. Now you
                    do. If you have a chance - you should read that piece too.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway. On with the story. We went to this cafe because I offered coffee (as a student does) for
                    everyone to celebrate this day for our friend - and also just to let her know that either way today
                    would
                    be a good day- whether he remembered or not (again, he didn't).
                </p>

                <p>
                    At first, it was just myself, my two friends and my boyfriend. We were just sitting, talking and
                    waiting for my friend's boyfriend. A lot of the conversation was centred on oour single friend - she
                    loves to talk and she's
                    just generally the vibe of our group - we love her a lot. She spoke about boys and friends and we
                    spoke about them with her. We talked about coffee and disappointment and it was nice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then we started to speak cake - mind you this is a cafe type place we were at, with a whole lot of
                    cakes on display.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I don't like cake," said my boyfriend, "It's too sweet and generally just - I don't like it."
                </p>

                <p>
                    He looked at me as if to check if this was a dealbreaker but all I could do was smile. I don't like
                    cake either to be honest. To have to not explain myself was quite nice for a change. I told him this
                    and he smiled back and I told him that there were only two exceptions - cheesecake and carrot cake.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He smiled widely and the look of joy on his face told me everything. We got up and as we did, my
                    friend's boyfriend arrived and they spoke while my single friend called aother one of our friends,
                    making plans for after coffee since we wereall free anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anyway, we got upto see if there were any exceptions displayed and we found carrot cakeand some
                    baklava (sweet but not cake either way). We ordered a portion of each to share at the table- and we
                    still didn't finish.

                </p>

                <p>
                    As you can see, there's no real moral or anything here but it was nice to know that he also doesn't
                    like cake.
