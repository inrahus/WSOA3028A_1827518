                    A Digital Arts 3rd Year @ Wits University who really likes socio-political convos, YA novels,
                    Korean
                    Pop music and art with a focus on colour ecperimentation, as well as photography.

                    As the daughter of an Indian man and a Coloured woman in the South African context, dealing with
                    racism on both the local and international scales have shaped many of my core qualities and my
                    deep
                    obsession with understanding the other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growing up, I lived in Mauritius for a while, and I consider the island my childhood home. I moved
                    back to South Africa just as high school started and have been trying to navigate this context
                    that
                    really values racial and cultural identities.

                </p>

                    So here we are..
